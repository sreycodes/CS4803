    "* The ’deconvolution’ is equivalent to a backward pass through the network, except that when propagating through a nonlinearity, its gradient is solely computed based on the top gradient signal, ignoring the bottom input. In case of the ReLU nonlinearity this amounts to setting to zero certain entries based on the top gradient. We propose to combine these two methods: rather than masking out values corresponding to negative entries of the top gradient (’deconvnet’) or bottom data (backpropagation), we mask out the values for which at least one of these values is negative."
